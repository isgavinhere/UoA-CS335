# UoA-CS335

Solutions to past COMPSCI 335 exams/tests.

This repo only exists based on student contributions. If you have an answer that you think may be useful to others, please go ahead and open a pull request!

If you're not 100% confident with using GitHub, [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) should get you up-to-speed pretty quickly.

## Why?

This repo exists because past attempts at this sort of thing have been a pretty huge fail. By using GitHub, we can control who edits what, and make sure the answers in the documents here are correct (or at least, pretty close).

This also means that, to keep everything tidy and understandable, we have to be a little bit fussy when accepting answers. Please keep your commits to editing a single file, and only make pull requests for one or two commits at a time. This makes merging easier. If you're contributing a new answer, make sure to follow the CSV format and to contain your explanations in double quotes.

Keep your commits short and understandable, and follow the [seven rules of a good commit](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). If you're not sure, the commit messages for changes that have already been accepted should give you a pretty good idea.

If you're still unsure, or you'd just rather spend time studying than learning git, post a good explanation on the class facebook page. If you're nice, someone else might commit it for you!
